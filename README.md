## How to play

The game is pretty self-explanatory. Press space bar to start the game. Then use the `up` and `down` keys to select 1 player or 2 player mode. Use the same keys to select the world to play in. Then select
your character(s) and press `enter`.

* Player 1 gets the `left`, `right`, `up`, `down`, `shift`, and `enter` keys.

* Player 2 gets the `w`, `a`, `s`, `d`, `q`, and `e` keys.

The left and right keys will move your character. The up key jumps, and the down key makes your character idle. `shift` (`q` for player 2) attacks, and `enter` (`e` for player 2) drops a block.

You win the level by killing all the enemies. Then you will progress to the next level, which will be a bit harder every time.
